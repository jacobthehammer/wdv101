        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Nineteen years ago, my brother and I decided we would send videos back and forth to each other every weekday for the entirety of 2007. It was a very silly idea during a very silly time on the internet. It was fun, it was weird, and it was very much inspired by an extremely similar project done by Ze Frank.</p>
        <p>But unlike Ze, when the year was over, John and I (possibly because there were two of us, so it was half as much work) decided to keep going. Though from 2008 on, we cut way down on the number of videos we were making. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't get nostalgic for the old ways of 2007. So, two weeks a year, we go back to the old schedule, and THAT is what Pizzamas is.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of very good things about my job, but being able to intentionally turn back the clock and go back to an older, simpler version of my job is definitely one of them. Nostalgia is a powerful thing, and it makes sense that I would be nostalgic for that weird, wonderful, silly little year of 2007. It was a year that changed my entire life based on an idea that SHOULD NOT HAVE WORKED. But here we are, older, busier, more tired...but with a chance every once in a while to plug back into an era that is long gone by.</p>
        <p>I'm loving it. This week, we made videos about the scientific legacy of Jane Goodall, whether or not we will retire someday, and the very real and very important reasons for hope. Next week, I don't know what I'll make! That's what Pizzamas is like because that's what 2007 was like: being forced to have ideas in the pressure cooker of "You have to make a video today, or else!" So, we'll see... I'm pretty sure I'll come up with something good.</p>

        <h3>This Week at Complexly</h3>
        <p>What do we do with the money generated from pre-roll advertisements on the Vlogbrothers YouTube channel? Well, half of it goes to Partners in Health, one quarter goes to Complexly's new and developing educational video projects, and the other quarter goes into a fund that is used to help creators make online educational/informational/super awesome projects!</p>
        <p>If you're an online creator making stuff that helps make the world a better place, you can apply for a grant from the fund by filling out this form. To be eligible for this year's grants, make sure you apply by November 2, 2025.</p>
